Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is collecting and analysing data from open sources to get intelligence about that source. 
According to CIA, OSINT is intelligence “drawn from publicly available material”.

Open-source doesn’t mean the open-source software movement. It refers to describing the data being analysed as publicly available.
OSINT does not require hack into systems or using confidential credentials to access data. 
Viewing someone’s public profile on social media is `OSINT`; using their login details to information is not.
