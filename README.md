## whoami

My name is __Fil88__ a random offensive security researcher and wanna be red teamer. With this blog, I want to share a part of the Research & Development work I do on my spare time. 
This blog post has been updated based on some tools and techniques from __Offensive__ __Securityâ€™s__ __PEN-300__ course as well ad the CRTO course from __Rastamouse__. 
It should be useful in a lot of cases when dealing with Windows / AD exploitation. This is my quick and dirty cheat sheet.
